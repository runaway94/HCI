\section{Card Sorting}\label{Card Sorting}

We decided on a level of granularity for our card sorting and everyone in the group participated in doing the card sorting. The functions and the division into scopes were taken from the results of the heuristic evaluation, the competitive analysis and the usability guidelines. The result is shown in the image below.

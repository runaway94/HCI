\section{Sketching and Paper Prototyping}

    \subsection{Sketching}
        For Sketching out team met every Monday and Tuesday to discuses our ideas. Everyone had time to present. Everyone had the opportunity to share his ideas with the team. After that we discussed the pros and cons of the ideas and decided which functionalities and aspects we can include in our project.
        
    \subsection{Paper Prototyping}
        For the first draft of the landing page we did a paper prototype. We used some elements from this first drafts to design our layout for Lend'n'Rent.

			\noindent
			From the first Paper Prototype we take over that the search bar and the Profile picture are included in the navigation bar on top of the website. The Offers we worked into the categories page.

			\noindent
			From Prototype 2 we taken over the left sidebar for the majority of our page flow including the functionality to use a map to look for tools around your area instead using a formula where you need to type your location.

			\noindent
			From the Prototype 4 we decided to use the arrow under the profile picture to allow user to open a drop down menu to easier navigate.
